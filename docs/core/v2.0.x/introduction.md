> Via Profit services / **Core** - [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) server based on [Express](http://expressjs.com) framework

Lightweight, flexible, standalone implementation of a [GraphQL HTTP (express middleware)](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql) which allows you to run an Express GraphQL server, build connections with pagination (Cursored or Limit-offset type), make your own extentions, read detailed logs, use global context with structured dataloaders and module containers, use some extra GraphQL Scalar types as DateTime, Money and so on

You can discover a list of extentions in our organisation repository [via-profit-services](https://github.com/via-profit-services)

We always use those package in our commercial projects like CRM systems, websites and so on. Any help with development, testing and docs would be highly appreciated.
