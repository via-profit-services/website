## About this documentation

Initially, this documentation was created for internal use, but later it was published for general use. The documentation contains information about all modules that are being developed by our company as part of the @via-profit-services project.


The numbering of versions corresponds to the rule: modules of the same major version are compatible with each other. In this regard, some modules may have version 2, but not have version 1.

Any module somehow depends on the [Core](./docs/core/introduction.md) package


## How to read?

How to read this documentation? The documentation should be used as a module reference. Each module has its own documentation section, but in some cases there may be a mention of another module in the text of one package.

For navigation, it is most convenient to use sidebar (left) for the desktop version and drawer menu (bottom right) for the mobile version.

## Examples

You can find most of the examples on codesandox at this link - [https://codesandbox.io/search/?query=@via-profit-services](https://codesandbox.io/search?query=%40via-profit-services). The text may contain both a non-real code example and a real working code example. Non-real code blocks will be accompanied by a link to the code sandbox.
